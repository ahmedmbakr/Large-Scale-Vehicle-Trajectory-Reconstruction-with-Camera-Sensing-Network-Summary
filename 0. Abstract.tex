Vehicle trajectories are crucial for understanding urban mobility and benefiting various applications.
Modern vehicle sensing solutions may not fully understand all vehicle trajectories.
In this paper, we present a summary of the paper \cite{tong2021large}, where VeTrac is proposed, which uses widely deployed traffic cameras throughout the city as a sensing network to track and reconstruct vehicle trajectories on a large scale with greater accuracy than previous work.
% I might get rid of the following sentence.
A graph convolution process ensures consistency across camera observations, while a self-training process reconstructs vehicle trajectories with confidence through alignment with the urban road network.
In real-world experiments, VeTrac achieved 98\% accuracy for simple expressways and 89\% accuracy for complex urban environments using over 7 million vehicle snapshots from over 1,000 traffic cameras.
The accuracy achieved surpasses alternatives by 32\% for expressways and 59\% for complex urban environments.
