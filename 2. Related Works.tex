Most of the state of the art papers focused on mobility trajectory recovery and vision based vehicle \ac{re-id}.
For mobility based trajectory recovery, the literature has focused on using Kalman filter \cite{el2005road}, Hidden Markov Model \cite{newson2009hidden} to perform map matching.
In addition, other works have focused on the usage of GPS \cite{hassanieh2012faster} and Wifi networks \cite{liu2012push, qi2017vehicle} and vehicular network, which are costly and need users' consent.
\ac{lpr} \cite{simonyan2014very} scheme depicts common practice of obtaining vehicle trajectories from camera data only using VGG-16 network.
In \cite{liu2017provid}, vehicle \ac{re-id} scheme is presented that depends only on the visual appearance of the vehicle.
Finally, \ac{hris} scheme is presented in \cite{zheng2012reducing} that is considered as mobility-based method that reduces uncertainties of low-sampling-rate trajectories instead of looking at camera images.
