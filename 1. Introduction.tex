\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Motivation.
Understanding the moving trajectories of millions of vehicles in a city offers valuable insights into urban mobility, enabling applications such as usage-based electronic toll collection, accurate traffic analysis, intelligent traffic light control, and retrospective urban planning analysis.
% Related work.
Current trajectory reconstruction methods rely on in-vehicle devices (e.g., GPS) for partial knowledge, and roadway monitoring with flow sensors (e.g., loop detectors, piezoelectric sensors, infrared sensors) for capturing traffic flows.

% Their work and contributions.
This research explores the use of traffic cameras as a sensing network to accurately recreate citywide vehicle trajectory.
The traffic camera network offers advantages over existing alternatives, including: (i) Traffic cameras are widely available and cost-effective for urban deployment; (ii) They provide high coverage for sensing and monitoring vehicle trajectories; (iii) Advanced image analysis techniques can extract vehicle identifiers, enabling trajectories recovery with higher accuracy.
Vetrac was experimented on using real-world data collected from one full day of one of China's urban road networks, which covers $66 km^2$.
\Cref{fig:china-road-representation} represents the road network, where white dots present rear-view cameras, while red dots present front-view cameras.
Each camera records the following information: camera metadata, snapshot, entering time, exit time, and lane directions.
Overall, seven million snapshots were collected, and 1,247,835 vehicle trajectories have been reconstructed.
