\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This study presented a vehicle trajectory reconstruction system that reconstructs the trajectories of generic traffics using widely deployed traffic cameras as a sensing network.
Large-scale studies with city-wide camera sensing data indicate that VeTrac has great accuracy and efficiency.
It is believed that VeTrac design gives insights that can be applied to various types of mobility studies.
